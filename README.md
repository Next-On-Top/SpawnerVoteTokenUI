# SpawnerVoteTokenUI
## What is the purpose?
  The pupose of this plugin is to provide a GUI where you can deposit and withdraw vote Tokens, to use a currency to buy in the VoteToken shop in the GUI. There are permissions that will be added during the remake. Config will be significantly improved from the last iteration of this plugin
  
## What are the Permissions?
  TBA
  
## Where can I download it?
  I don't have the current version but if you want to acquire the old version then you can go to github.com/nayoshi12/PotatoTests and compile it for yourself, or if I feel like it I will provide a download.
  
## When will this be finished?
  Hopefully before the year ends.. maybe
  
## Why are you doing this?
  nayoshi: I'm bored. Furthermore, I would like to have more experience with Java programming, as I want to take CS in college. I might try and earn some money from it. idk about the last statement.
